# Multi-Agent path finding with SAT

This project demonstrates the use of SAT solvers to schedule path finding in multi agents systems.
The implementation is based on [Efficient SAT Approach to Multi-Agent Path Finding
under the Sum of Costs Objective](http://surynek.net/publications/files/Surynek-Felner-Stern-Boyarski_Efficient-Cost-Encoding_WoMAPF-2016.pdf)

# UI

![UI](doc/images/screenshot_demo.png)
The demonstrator provides a playground for simulating different cell based agent paths.

## Features

- UI for adding and managing agents
- Store agent setups in presets to load them later
- Selection of maps including DAO-maps mentioned in the paper
